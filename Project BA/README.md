## Dashboards

*"Contain the most important KPIs for report automation"*

Dashboard for managing, sharing, and gauging the KPIs that evaluate progress on any goal, either short or long-term. Present data in a clear way that aids in making decisions.

* Dashboard for managing, sharing, and gauging the KPIs that evaluate progress on any goal, either short or long-term. Present data in a clear way that aids in making decisions.
* Dashboards below using advanced excel, pivot, and slicer pivot. Focusing on sales and profit performance of the product and region.

Design of dashboards to provide a quick overview of company performance and help manage companies to be able to make decisions quickly, by providing accurate and up-to-date data, and analyzing data to determine important trends and patterns to display on the dashboard.


## Data Visualization

*"Based on this report, clear and well-founded decisions can be made, costs can be saved and processes optimized"*

Often, companies have data that contain a lot of hidden information.  Using data analysis increases efficiency and improves performance by discovering patterns in data. 

The goal is to answer the right questions that will help the company to make the right decisions. Based on this report, clear and well-founded decisions can be made, costs can be saved and processes optimized.

### [Business Intelligence: Optimize Performance Shipping Courier in Indonesia using SQL and Tableau](https://github.com/Haniaghnia/Business_Analyst/blob/d1bbfd715f51ca59953e9c61417e0ba17a42d07c/Project%20BA/Shipping%20Courier/Shipping%20Courier.md)
* In the shipping industry (courier), the main aspect that can determine the quality of an expedition is whether or not the delivery time is received by the customer. Factors that affect delivery time need to be analyzed periodically.
* A brief descriptive description is the initial stage carried out to determine the characteristics of the shipping data using the expedition, determine the parameters that have a large correlation and carry out further analysis focused on these variables, in order to improve the quality of the freight forwarding expedition in the future.
* Using SQL Queries first to pre-process data such as removing outliers, making price rounding calculations, and creating new columns that can be used to help correlation analysis for each variable.

### [E-Commerce Business Performance](https://github.com/Haniaghnia/Business_Analyst/blob/d1bbfd715f51ca59953e9c61417e0ba17a42d07c/Project%20BA/eCommerce%20Business%20Performance/eCommerce%20Business%20Performance.md)

* Performed data preparation and created ERD.
* Analyzing several metrics related to customer activities such as the number of active customers, the number of new customers, the number of customers who make repeat orders, and also the average number of transactions made by customers every year.
* Analyze the performance of each existing product category and how it relates to the company's revenue.
* Analyzing the performance of existing payment types can provide insight into creating a better strategic partnership with payment service providers.
* 

## Problem Solving with Analytics

*"Data analytics helps solve problems before they happen, points the way to systemic solutions, and brings value to businesses by solving problems and providing insights"*

### [Credit Risk Analysis and Portfolio Management]([https://github.com/Haniaghnia/Hani_Portfolio/blob/main/Power%20BI/DE/Project%20DE.md](https://github.com/Haniaghnia/Business_Analyst/blob/d1bbfd715f51ca59953e9c61417e0ba17a42d07c/Project%20BA/Power%20BI/Credit%20Card/Credit%20card.md)
* Analyzing Bank  BTPN credit card customer database, see the risks that will arise, and how preventive actions can be taken. 
* Using a methodology with seven steps to solve the problem Identify the business objectives, Define the problem statement and goals of the analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Analyze the data, Draw a conclusion and develop a portfolio management plan.
* With the data that is owned, it performs data processing based on business objectives, data exploration and generates insights for the company.
* Data exploration performs datamart design with SQL based on the problems identified in the business objective, the final stage is making visualizations using Power BI to understand and explore data to make it more effective.


## Classification Models
*"Use classification models to predict customer behavior, identify fraud, and improve customer segmentation. An algorithm, probability estimation, or statistical model to draw conclusions and make the right decisions"*

### [Customer Lifetime Value Prediction]([https://github.com/Haniaghnia/Hani_Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science/Machine%20Learning/RFM/Customer%20lifetime%20value.md](https://github.com/Haniaghnia/Business_Analyst/blob/d1bbfd715f51ca59953e9c61417e0ba17a42d07c/Project%20BA/Python/Customer%20Lifetime%20Value%20Prediction/Customer%20Lifetime%20Value%20Prediction.md)

Customer lifetime value predicts how much revenue a customer can bring to the business, improve retention, allocate the right resources, and make informed decisions about marketing and sales strategies.

* Define an appropriate time frame, Identify the features that are going to use to predict the future
* Calculate lifetime value (LTV) for training the machine learning model
* Build and run the machine learning model
* Share the results and insights for the company and recommendations for steps that need to be taken

### [Lending company risk prediction](https://github.com/Haniaghnia/Business_Analyst/blob/d1bbfd715f51ca59953e9c61417e0ba17a42d07c/Project%20BA/Python/Lending%20company%20risk%20prediction/Lending%20company%20risk%20prediction.md)
* Build a model that can predict credit risk to increase the number of current consumers and reduce or reject potential customers who have a high chance of experiencing a risk of default
* Using random forest algorithm for modeling to predict lending company risk prediction. And evaluate Model Performance using AUC and KS.
* Share the results and insights for the company and recommendations for steps that need to be taken

## Project Management
*"Understand business requirements, including getting to know existing business problems and processes in depth"*

### [Project Coffee Shop with Agile Methodology](https://github.com/Haniaghnia/Business_Analyst/blob/d1bbfd715f51ca59953e9c61417e0ba17a42d07c/Project%20BA/Coffee%20Shop/README.md)

* Analyze Coffee Shop's business development, especially for new products, and how to improve the new products. The data is processed using SQL queries to explore the data, and using Tableau for visualization.
* There are many ways to perform EDA, one of which is by conducting Univariate, BI variate and multivariate analysis. Furthermore, it is sharpened by sales analysis to    create a Product Drill Down visualization which aims to find out which products have good sales performance, whenever the product is purchased a lot, which product categories are sold the most and at which outlets are the best sales.
* Customer habits and customer profiles are important factors in determining the improvement strategy for sales. In this section we look at the gender, loyalty, and age range of customers who are more likely to try new products. Monitoring customer behavior to find out when we should recommend new products and to what kind of customers for product offerings.




## Data Analytics

*"Making predictions to  increase efficiency and improve performance by discovering patterns in data"*
 
Helps a business optimize performance, perform more efficiently, maximize profit, or make more strategically-guided decisions.  Use an algorithm, probability estimation, or statistical model to draw conclusions and make the right decisions.
